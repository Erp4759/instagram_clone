# Instagram-like Flutter UI (starter)

This workspace contains a minimal Flutter scaffold to start building an Instagram-like interface.

## What I added
- `lib/main.dart` — starter UI skeleton (stories + grid posts + bottom bar)
- `pubspec.yaml` — project manifest with common dependencies
- `.gitignore`
- `assets/images/` — placeholder folder for local assets

## Prerequisites
- macOS with a working terminal (zsh).
- Install Flutter SDK: follow https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Ensure `flutter` is on your PATH and run `flutter doctor`.

## Quick start
Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
cd /Users/erikp/Documents/vscode/inst/instagram_clone
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If you want to open the project in VS Code, use `code .` and install the Flutter and Dart extensions.

## Next steps I can do for you
- Wire up navigation and dummy post detail pages
- Add login/signup flows
- Add local assets and example images
- Add tests and CI config

Tell me which next step you'd like, or run the app and tell me any issues you encounter.
